"IIWT44GS","thesis","2020","Stefanescu, Dimitrie A.","Alternate Means of Digital Design Communication","","","","","https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10110102/","This thesis reconceptualises communication in digital design as an integrated social and technical process. The friction in the communicative processes pertaining to digital design can be traced to the fact that current research and practice emphasise technical concerns at the expense of social aspects of design communication. With the advent of BIM (Building Information Modelling), a code model of communication (machine-to-machine) is inadequately applied to design communication. This imbalance is addressed in this thesis by using inferential models of communication to capture and frame the psychological and social aspects behind the communicative contracts between people. Three critical aspects of the communicative act have been analysed, namely (1) data representation, (2) data classification and (3) data transaction, with the help of a new digital design communication platform, Speckle, which was developed during this research project for this purpose. By virtue of an applied living laboratory context, Speckle facilitated both qualitative and quantitative comparisons against existing methodologies with data from real-world settings. Regarding data representation (1), this research finds that the communicative performance of a low-level composable object model is better than that of a complete and universal one as it enables a more dynamic process of ontological revision. This implies that current practice and research operates at an inappropriate level of abstraction. On data classification (2), this thesis shows that a curatorial object-based data sharing methodology, as opposed to the current file-based approaches, leads to increased relevancy and a reduction in noise (information without intent, or meaning). Finally, on data transaction (3), the analysis shows that an object-based data sharing methodology is technically better suited to enable communicative contracts between stakeholders. It allows for faster and more meaningful change-dependent transactions, as well as allow for the emergence of traceable communicative networks outside of the predefined exchanges of current practices.","2020-09-28","2025-03-16 15:22:46","2025-03-16 15:22:46","2025-03-16 15:22:46","","230","","","","","","","","","","UCL (University College London)","","eng","open","Doctoral","","","discovery.ucl.ac.uk","","Conference Name: UCL (University College London) Meeting Name: UCL (University College London) Publication Title: Doctoral thesis, UCL (University College London).","","/home/dorten/Zotero/storage/NFFFVW59/Stefanescu - 2020 - Alternate Means of Digital Design Communication.pdf; /home/dorten/Zotero/storage/W2I8PE2C/10110102.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry has witnessed the emergence of custom technological solutions tailored within some of the most progressive architecture practices to better understand and visualize complex digital design workflows. Although very relevant, such existing solutions have always been developed in isolation to solve particular design problems related to the conception and construction of a specific building project. Based on this observation, the open-source data platform for AEC called Speckle has been developed in order to bring more transparency in the design process, enabling multiple stakeholders working from different software environments to seamlessly communicate through its web interface. The present paper both introduces the platform and describes an interactive data flow diagram – named SpeckleViz – built upon it to support in a user friendly manner transparent collaborative design, project management and version control for AEC.

However, coverage of the theory of BIM diffusion (which combines contextual and technical issues of the applications) remains scant and underdeveloped. Compatibility is one of the key contextual factors of Diffusion of Innovation theory that involves predicting BIM adopters' behaviours and identifying what components require extra effort for successful BIM implementation. However, this important theoretical concept has not been developed in pertinent BIM literature nor used correctly to extend existing knowledge because compatibility variables are not understood in a construction context. This seriously impedes the correct usage of BIM in construction. This study systematically and critically reviews BIM compatibility (BIM-COM) literature to distinguish compatibility issues at the organisational level and the concept of interoperability at the technical level. A sample of 57 out of the 131 articles constituted secondary data and each paper represented the unit of analysis. Bibliographic analysis techniques were used to identify co-authoring network and contents' concentration in the created bibliography. Content analysis and text mining approaches were employed using a thematic clustering analysis for grouping authors and themes within articles. The findings illustrate that the concept of compatibility is surprisingly poorly understood and often overlooked in the literature. The paper argues that interoperability issues prevail as the key practical barrier to BIM implementation. The paper identifies a large knowledge gap in terms of improving compatibility measures, which should be employed by innovators to assess their BIM applications before they offer it to construction companies. The findings presented will help to extend BIM applications and speed up the adoption rate among stakeholders with different needs and using different file formats.","2020-04-01","2024-10-30 19:42:31","2024-10-30 19:42:31","2024-10-30 19:42:31","103086","","","112","","Automation in Construction","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/dorten/Zotero/storage/AVMNL7GF/1-s2.0-S0926580519309215-main.pdf; /home/dorten/Zotero/storage/LX6SCGP9/S0926580519309215.html","","","Adoption; BIM; Compatibility; Data and model exchange; Implementation; Interoperability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BIM is supported by various tools, technologies and contracts. Building information models (BIMs) are computer files (often but not always in proprietary formats and containing proprietary data) which can be extracted, exchanged or networked to support decision-making regarding a built asset. BIM software is used by individuals, businesses and government agencies who plan, design, construct, operate and maintain buildings and diverse physical infrastructures, such as water, refuse, electricity, gas, communication utilities, roads, railways, bridges, ports and tunnels. The concept of BIM has been in development since the 1970s, but it only became an agreed term in the early 2000s. The development of standards and the adoption of BIM has progressed at different speeds in different countries. Developed by buildingSMART, Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs) – data structures for representing information – became an international standard, ISO 16739, in 2013, and BIM process standards developed in the United Kingdom from 2007 onwards formed the basis of an international standard, ISO 19650, launched in January 2019.","2024-10-05","2024-10-30 13:58:11","2024-10-30 13:58:11","2024-10-30 13:58:11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","","","","Wikipedia","","Page Version ID: 1249574385","","/home/dorten/Zotero/storage/UB8HN3XX/Building_information_modeling.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these studies used varying approaches for IFC extensions and validation, making it difficult to identify research gaps and agree on legitimate extension protocols. This study collected 64 studies of IFC schema extensions spanning over two decades, from 2001 to 2022. The analysis first focused on categorizing these cases with respect to their target domains and sectors, their purpose and extension approaches, as well as their methods for implementation and validation. Timeline analyses were also conducted to track the temporal trends over the specified period. The results revealed that architectural cases have recently shifted from process to product representations due to new technology adoptions, while infrastructure cases, initially centered on major sector elements, have transitioned towards operation and maintenance processes. The findings also showed the need for a more holistic and organized approach for extensions, as current ad hoc developments were limited to products and processes only applicable for specific sectors.","2023-01","2024-10-30 13:53:31","2024-10-30 13:53:31","2024-10-30 13:53:31","12560","","23","13","","","","","","","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 23","","/home/dorten/Zotero/storage/RPHA8PS8/Yu et al. - 2023 - A Systematic Review of the Trends and Advances in IFC Schema Extensions for BIM Interoperability.pdf","","","building information modeling; IFC literature review; IFC schema extension; industry foundation classes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A benchmark study, covering three years of software releases is illustrated; the assessment of the software performance was made with reference to criteria associated with the software’s level of suitability for use of the structural models. Four classes of performance, depending on the accuracy of the data transfer and on the associated corrective actions to be taken, were adopted. This confirmed that at the moment, the implementation of the IFC standard by software manufacturers is geared towards an expert class of users. Further efforts are needed in order to ensure its application is adopted by a wider class, thus extending and regulating its use by national, regional, and local authorities.","2021-01","2024-10-24 12:46:05","2024-10-24 12:46:05","2024-10-24 12:46:05","11430","","23","11","","","On BIM Interoperability via the IFC Standard","","","","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 23","","/home/dorten/Zotero/storage/693U93WZ/Gerbino et al. - 2021 - On BIM Interoperability via the IFC Standard An Assessment from the Structural Engineering and Desi.pdf","","","BIM interoperability; building information modelling (BIM); computer-aided design (CAD); computer-aided engineering (CAE); data exchange; Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study is to investigate the barriers to BIM implementation at AEC (architecture, management, construction, and quantity survey) companies in Jordan, and to look at the similarities and differences in perceptions on the significance of these barriers between respondents from different AEC companies. To accomplish these objectives, a questionnaire survey was created to gather feedback on the 20 major barriers to BIM implementation identified through a comprehensive literature review. The top significant barriers were identified using the Relative Importance Index (RII) and Mean value; and to assess variances between respondents in the four AEC firms, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. From this, it was concluded that the “cost of training”, “cost of BIM software”, “insufficient BIM technical knowledge and awareness”, “lack of adequate BIM guidelines”, and “huge BIM up frontal investment” are the key barriers affecting the BIM implementation in Jordanian AEC companies. Considering this, this study provides an important step towards better understanding the implementation of BIM in Jordan.","2022-02","2024-10-21 15:33:15","2024-10-21 15:33:15","2024-10-21 15:33:15","150","","2","12","","","","","","","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 2","","/home/dorten/Zotero/storage/5AI8MXRQ/Hyarat et al. - 2022 - Barriers to the Implementation of Building Information Modeling among Jordanian AEC Companies.pdf","","","architecture; barriers; building information modeling (BIM); construction; construction industry; Jordan; management; quantity survey (AEC) companies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Building Information Modeling (BIM) methods offer a potential solution by enhancing project management and coordination. Nevertheless, comprehensive case study research on BIM implementation challenges and benefits in renovation projects is lacking. This research addresses this gap through an ethnographic investigation of BIM implementation in a complex renovation project. The ethnographic methods involved direct observation of project meetings, active engagement in all project communications, and access to project data resources. Additionally, surveys and expert interviews with key decision-makers were conducted. The findings reveal how BIM implementation streamlined project management and improved communication, decision making, and output quality, despite limited prior BIM expertise among the major stakeholders. Challenges included a lack of BIM skills, absence of standardized practices, and unclear data management. Furthermore, valuable lessons were identified, including that the necessity of BIM requirements and proper procurement methods encompassing the entire project workflow, formalizing information exchange, preventing information fragmentation, facilitating model accessibility, and ensuring clarity in model detail and content are crucial for project success.

Focusing on the wood construction industry, BIM is becoming a necessity; this is due to its high level of prefabrication and complex digital procedures using wood sawing machines and sophisticated cuttings. However, the full implementation of BIM is still far from reality. The main objective of this paper is to explore the barriers affecting BIM implementation in the Swedish construction industry. An extensive literature review was conducted to extract barriers hindering the implementation of BIM in the construction industry. Secondly, barriers to the implementation of BIM in the wood construction industry in Sweden were extracted using the grounded theory methodology to analyse expert input on the phenomenon of low BIM implementation in the wood construction industry in Sweden. Thirty-four barriers were identified. The analysis of this study also led to the development of a conceptual model that recommended solutions to overcome the barriers identified to help maximise BIM implementation within the wood construction industry. Identifying the main barriers affecting BIM implementation is essential to guide organisational decisions and drive policy, particularly for governments that are considering articulating regulations to expand BIM implementation.","2022-08","2024-10-21 12:55:49","2024-10-21 13:00:53","2024-10-21 12:55:49","1067","","8","12","","","An Empirical Analysis of Barriers to Building Information Modelling (BIM) Implementation in Wood Construction Projects","","","","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 8","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p><span style=""background-color: #ffd40080"">The wood construction industry should focus on solving interoperability issues between BIM models and CNC machines.

BIM is a technology for creating and managing building projects using their virtual models. These virtual models help architects and engineers visualise the structure to identify potential design, construction or operational issues. The software enables the creation of detailed 3D models filled with data about the physical object. Designers, architects and contractors collaborate on these models, refining projects and resolving potential issues before construction begins, resulting in more efficient and error-free construction. The software is used by individuals and companies planning the construction and maintenance of a wide range of infrastructure, including water, electricity and gas utilities, roads, railways, bridges, ports and even tunnels.","2023-12-03","2024-10-18 12:22:03","2024-10-18 12:22:19","2024-10-18 12:22:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","","","","","/home/dorten/Zotero/storage/4P99PZ97/what-is-bim.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This translates into sensors that measure proximity to neighbors and algorithms that scale exponentially with the number of robots. In many cases, these problems are solved very differently in nature, especially at smaller scales. The penalty due to collisions is small at these scales and sensors and controllers are not precise enough to guarantee collision-free trajectories. We explore a similar approach with small flying robots. We present a design that is capable of sustaining collisions, controllers that are able to recover from collisions, and simple motion planners that allow the robots to navigate without complete knowledge of the environment.

To advance towards safer autonomous aerial robots, this work presents a vision-based solution to ensuring safe autonomous UAV landings with minimal infrastructure. During docking maneuvers, UAVs pose a hazard to people in the vicinity. In this paper, we propose the use of a single omnidirectional panoramic camera pointing upwards from a landing pad to detect and estimate the position of people around the landing area. The images are processed in real-time in an embedded computer, which communicates with the onboard computer of approaching UAVs to transition between landing, hovering or emergency landing states. While landing, the ground camera also aids in finding an optimal position, which can be required in case of low-battery or when hovering is no longer possible. We use a YOLOv7-based object detection model and a XGBooxt model for localizing nearby people, and the open-source ROS and PX4 frameworks for communication, interfacing, and control of the UAV. We present both simulation and real-world indoor experimental results to show the efficiency of our methods.","2023-11-23","2025-11-10 18:56:13","2025-11-10 18:56:13","2025-11-10 18:56:13","","","","10","","Front.

The key novelty of this work lies in the integration of a novel multi-objective Self-Adaptive Bonobo optimizer to optimize eighteen controller gains simultaneously, leveraging Pareto-front principles for the first time in this context to effectively balance tracking accuracy with control effort. The proposed controllers robustly handle the nonlinear and coupled dynamics of the quadcopter while maintaining resilience against disturbances and model uncertainties. The obtained results validate the efficacy of this approach, demonstrating significant improvements, including up to a 51% reduction in root mean square error and 76% reduction in mean absolute error in lateral motion over baseline configurations, without compromising altitude stability and with enhanced response times compared to random gains selection. Furthermore, the control scheme is validated via real-time implementation on a dSPACE 1202 Processor-in-the-Loop platform under aggressive trajectory conditions. Finally, a novel conceptual framework is proposed for deploying these optimized fuzzy controllers directly on embedded flight hardware under aggressive trajectories, creating efficient autonomous onboard control and representing a practical step towards real-world Unmanned Aerial Vehicles applications.","2025-11-17","2025-12-01 09:30:24","2025-12-01 09:30:24","2025-12-01 09:30:24","40262","","1","15","","Sci Rep","","","","","","Nature Publishing Group","","en","2025 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","","","/home/dorten/Zotero/storage/QUFIIFYJ/Benhammou et al. - 2025 - Six degree of freedom quadcopter stabilization using self adaptive bonobo Pareto multi objective FLC.pdf","","","Engineering; Mathematics and computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A quadcopter is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is able to do vertical take-off and landing. This study presents a nonlinear quadcopter system’s mathematical modeling and control for stabilization and trajectory tracking. The mathematical model of the system dynamics of the quadcopter is derived using Newton and Euler equations with proper references to the appropriate frame or coordinate system. A PD control algorithm is developed for the nonlinear system for stabilization. Another nonlinear control technique called full state feedback linearization (FBL) using nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) is developed and implemented on the quadcopter system. However, there is a problem with the normal approach of the complete derivation of the full state FBL system using NDI as gathered from the literature review. In such an approach, the PD controller that was used for attitude stabilization was able to stabilize the angles to zero states, but the position variables cannot be stabilized because the state variables are not observable. Thus, a new approach where the position variables are mapped to the angle variables which are controllable so as to drive all states to zero stability was proposed in this study. The aim of the study was achieved but the downside is that it takes a longer time to achieve this stability so it is not efficient and should only be considered when absolute zero stability is the aim without considering time efficiency. The study further investigates the problem of nonlinear quadcopter system’s mathematical modelling and control for stabilization and trajectory tracking using the feedback linearization (FBL) technique combined with the PD controller. The proposed control algorithms are implemented on the quadcopter model using MATLAB and analyzed in terms of system stabilization and trajectory tracking. The PD controller produces satisfactory results for system stabilization, but the FBL system combined with the PD controller performs better for trajectory tracking of the quadcopter system.","2022","2025-12-01 09:32:27","2025-12-01 09:32:27","2025-12-01 09:32:27","2449901","","1","2022","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2022 Ademola Abdulkareem et al.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1155/2022/2449901","","/home/dorten/Zotero/storage/LLSEXQYG/Abdulkareem et al. - 2022 - Modeling and Nonlinear Control of a Quadcopter for Stabilization and Trajectory Tracking.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many of these applications require a multirotor UAV in order to maintain a stationary position in mid-air, and thus UAVs must be designed to be as stable as possible to reduce the need for excessive flight controller corrections and positioning errors, particularly under windy conditions. This research focuses on performing an empirical study on the effects of adding an inward propeller tilt angle, a design feature commonly used to improve stability in fixed-wing aircraft, on the flight stability of a quadrotor UAV. A ready-to-fly quadrotor UAV kit was assembled, and its propellers were tilted inward at various fixed angles of 0o, 5o and 10o, and the planar motion of the UAV was computed using object visual tracking software.

For that reason, there are currently examples of the use of UAVs in recreational, professional and research applications. Most of the commercial UAVs use Px4 for their operating system. Even though Px4 allows one to change the flight controller structure, the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) format is still by far the most popular choice. A selection of the PID controller parameters is required before the UAV can be used. Although there are guidelines for the design of PID parameters, they do not guarantee the stability of the UAV, which in many cases, leads to collisions involving the UAV during the calibration process. In this paper, an offline tuning procedure based on the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm for the attitude and altitude control of a Px4-based UAV is proposed. A Pareto dominance concept is used for the MOPSO to find values for the PID comparing parameters of step responses (overshoot, rise time and root-mean-square). Experimental results are provided to validate the proposed tuning procedure by using a quadrotor as a case study.","2020-06-04","2026-01-03 18:28:08","2026-01-03 18:28:17","","","","","7","","Aerospace","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/home/dorten/Zotero/storage/ZPIC4EMJ/Gomez et al. - 2020 - Pareto Optimal PID Tuning for Px4-Based Unmanned Aerial Vehicles by Using a Multi-Objective Particle.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we present a novel body-rate controller and an iterative thrust-mixing scheme, which improve the trajectory-tracking performance without requiring learning and reduce the yaw control error of a quadrotor, respectively. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, we present the ﬁrst algorithm to cope with motor saturations smartly by prioritizing control inputs which are relevant for stabilization and trajectory tracking. The presented body-rate controller uses LQR-control methods to consider both the body rate and the single motor dynamics, which reduces the overall trajectory-tracking error while still rejecting external disturbances well. Our iterative thrust-mixing scheme computes the four rotor thrusts given the inputs from a position-control pipeline. Through the iterative computation, we are able to consider a varying ratio of thrust and drag torque of a single propeller over its input range, which allows applying the desired yaw torque more precisely and hence reduces the yaw-control error. Our prioritizing motor-saturation scheme improves stability and robustness of a quadrotor’s ﬂight and may prevent unstable behavior in case of motor saturations. We demonstrate the improved trajectory tracking, yaw-control, and robustness in case of motor saturations in real-world experiments with a quadrotor.","2017-04","2026-01-03 16:57:47","2026-01-03 16:57:47","2026-01-03 16:57:47","476-482","","2","2","","IEEE Robot.

Inspired by arthropods’ exoskeletons, we design a simple, open source, easily manufactured, semi-rigid structure with soft joints that can withstand high-velocity impacts. With an exoskeleton, the protective shell becomes part of the main robot structure, thereby minimizing its loss in payload capacity. Our design is simple to build and customize using cheap components (e.g. bamboo skewers) and consumer-grade 3D printers. The result is CogniFly, a sub-250 g autonomous quadcopter that survives multiple collisions at speeds up to 7 m s−1. In addition to its collision-resilience, CogniFly carries sensors that allow it to ﬂy for approx. 17 min without the need of GPS or an external motion capture system, and it has enough computing power to run deep neural network models on-board. This structure becomes an ideal platform for high-risk activities, such as ﬂying in a cluttered environment or reinforcement learning training, by dramatically reducing the risks of damaging its own hardware or the environment.

This thesis investigates the development of SpinFly, a UAV system designed to address these challenges by integrating a protective structure with sensing capabilities for active inspection. SpinFly, built upon an open-source platform, features a 3D-printed hybrid PETG-TPU frame with a rotational outer shell coupled to a magnetic encoder, enabling contact-based odometry and enhanced collision resilience. Experimental drop tests demonstrated the system’s structural robustness, with the SpinFly drone withstanding repeated impacts from heights up to 200 cm without structural failure. Wall navigation tests, while hindered by flight instability and reliance on manual control, indicated that the magnetic encoder provided more consistent relative positional tracking along surfaces compared to the onboard IMU, though accurate long-distance traversal proved challenging due to intermittent wall contact. The findings suggest that leveraging a protective structure as an active sensing element is a feasible approach for UAVs in complex environments. However, realizing the full potential of SpinFly requires further development in flight stability, autonomous control, and sensor integration to overcome current limitations.","","2026-01-02 18:56:38","2026-01-02 18:56:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/dorten/Zotero/storage/Z66Z4XEL/Lerche and Faina - SpinFly UAV System for Active Inspection in the Pharmaceutical Industry.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
